To Do - 13 Oct

when game starts hide the title and buttons

build the functionality that shows the score on the player bar

build winner functionality
when game ends show the winner in the game area including a button to play again,
that refreshes the game.

finally add final bit of styling to the game



// GAME IDEA - DUCK HUNT
// my game will be based on duck hunt

// it will have an on click listener for an image of ducks moving across the
// screen.

// if a duck is clicked the player will score a point 
// either 5 points or 10 points not sure yet

// it will be a two player game, player 1 starting first.
// player will have certain amount of seconds game play maybe 
// between 15 and 20 seconds
// after player 1 has played, it will be player 2 turn.

// he will have the same game play as player one

// after player 1 and 2 have finished their game, the total 
// scores they have gained
// will be compared

// and a winner will be announced
